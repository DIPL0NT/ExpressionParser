TODO:

*   TO complete implementation of POSTFIX operators

*   TO implement evaluation of a tree to a list

*   TO fix memory leaks in evaluate_ExpressionTree()
*   TO decide where to release the tokens (in free_TokenVec() or in free_ExpressionTree() ?)

*   TO implement ExpressionContext (contains operators array and pointers to funcs:
                                        isOperatorChar (maybe not needed with the symbol tree implementation)
                                        alloc_Operand
                                        isOperandChar (maybe not needed with the symbol tree implementation)
                                        parseOperandStringFormatToVoidPtr
                                        release_OperandValue
                                        free_Operand
                                        print_OperandValue
                                        print_Operand
                                   )

*   TO solve problem that two operators written without space or parenthesis between them don't get recognized
	eg "2+-1" doesn't get recognized as "2 + -1" because it interprets "+-" as one symbol
	eg "Z+I" gets interpreted as one instead of "Z + I"

    Possible implementation:
    1) have a list of defined symbols
    2) create a decision tree with chars in the nodes
        s                   p                      
     u     q             o      r                   
   (sum) u    r      (power) (product)                              
    (square) (sqrt) 
    3) when scanning the input string follow the decision tree to see if the word is a recognized symbol or not

ExpressionTree_Creation.c : fill_INCOMPLETE_ExpressionTreeNode line 138 "if (currentNode->type==OPERATOR_NODE && currentNode->args.count+subtree->args.count > currentOp->arity){" maybe this check shouldn't be done because there could be another operator after that takes the arg ; in that case who checks that arg count is compatible with op arity at the end of the sub-expression
NVM IT SHOULD BE RIGHT, the only case is if the are PREFIXandINFIX operators mixed with POSTFIX operators

maybe concat_ExpressionTreeNode_List doesn't set the prev and next fields of the old and new tail correctely
