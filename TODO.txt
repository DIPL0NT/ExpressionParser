* 	1) Operator symbols don't include one of the reserved chars '\0', '(', ')', ','
* 	2) Operand string format doesn't include one the reserved chars '\0', '(', ')', ','
* 	3) No char is both in an Operator symbol and in the Operand string format
*   4) No two Operators have the same symbol (gets checked in create_SymbolTree too)

TODO:
	
*   TO solve problem that two operators written without space or parenthesis between them don't get recognized
	eg "2+-1" doesn't get recognized as "2 + -1" because it interprets "+-" as one symbol
	eg "Z+I" gets interpreted as one instead of "Z + I"

    Possible implementation:
    1) have a list of defined symbols
    2) create a decision tree with chars in the nodes
        s                   p                      
     u     q             o      r                   
   (sum) u    r      (power) (product)                              
    (square) (sqrt) 
    3) when scanning the input string follow the decision tree to see if the word is a recognized symbol or not

*   TO complete implementation of POSTFIX operators

*   TO implement evaluation of a tree to a list

*   TO decide where to release the tokens (in free_TokenVec or in free_ExpressionTree ?)

*   TO implement ExpressionContext (contains operators array and pointers to funcs:
                                        isOperatorChar (maybe not needed with the symbol tree implementation)
                                        alloc_Operand
                                        isOperandChar (maybe not needed with the symbol tree implementation)
                                        parseOperandStringFormatToVoidPtr
                                        release_OperandValue
                                        free_Operand
                                        print_OperandValue
                                        print_Operand
                                   )
